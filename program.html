<h3 id="russo">Preserving Privacy with Monads</h3>
<p><em>by <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/">Alejandro Russo</a></em></p>
<p>In a all-connected society, users consciously (or unconsciously) value their privacy. Even skeptical people will recognize its importance; if they do not, ask them to unlock their smartphone and hand it out to someone else—they will most probably refuse! Users want to have control on how their data gets disseminated, specially today when private information gets handled by software with heterogeneous trustworthiness—consider, for example, the various smartphones apps with access to users’ private photos, messages, and contacts that exists today. Unfortunately, current software practices are insufficient to protect privacy: users who wish to benefit from software functionality are often forced to grant access to their private data with no guarantees how it gets handled. The key insight to guarantee privacy is not about granting or denying access to private data, but ensuring that information only flows into the appropriated places.</p>
<p>Information-Flow Control (IFC) is a research area dedicated to protect privacy of data. Based on programming languages techniques, IFC scrutinizes source code to track how data of different sensitivity levels (e.g., public or private) flows within a program, where alarms are raised when privacy might be at stake. IFC tools often provide specially designed compilers to build privacy-preserving apps. Rather than building a compiler from scratch (a major task on its own), Haskell plays a unique privileged role in this scenario: it can provide IFC security via libraries. As long as developers program against the libraries’ API, code is secure by construction. This talk shows how to build such libraries by specially designing monads capable to restrict the propagation of private data. The presentation explores the different techniques used in a wide range of libraries, namely LIO, MAC, and HLIO, where IFC is enforced dynamically (in the form of an execution monitor), statically (by leveraging Haskell’s type-system), and as a combination of both.</p>

<p><em>by Balazs Komuves</em></p>
<p>Random access lists, as introduced by Okasaki<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, are persistent list-like data structures with faster lookup than linked lists. This talk will be an explanation of these data structures and their connection to numeral systems, with a small twist. I claim no originality at all.</p>
<p>The core idea is that you can take a positional numeral system, like the usual binary, ternary etc. numeral systems (or more esoteric ones, like the skew binary system), and “categorify it”, turning the length of a list (a number) into an actual sequence data type. In place of the digits you will have tuples of (full) trees: For example in the decimal system, if the digit at the hundreds place is 3, that will translate to a triple of 10-way trees, each containing 100 elements at the leaves.</p>
<p>The usual linked list corresponds to the unary system; but with the non-unary systems, you get O(log(k)) lookup, while modifying the left end of the list still remains on average O(1) (worst case is typically O(log(n)), though guaranteed O(1) can be achieved too). They can be also more compact in memory than linked lists (with GHC’s in-memory representation).</p>
<p>Okasaki used the standard tree representation, which is one of the first data types one meets when learning Haskell; for example, a leaf binary tree is represented as</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Tree</span> a
  <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Leaf</span> a
  <span class="fu">|</span> <span class="dt">Node</span> (<span class="dt">Tree</span> a) (<span class="dt">Tree</span> a)</code></pre></div>
<p>However, full binary trees can be also represented by a nested data type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Tree'</span> a
  <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Single</span> a
  <span class="fu">|</span> <span class="dt">Double</span> (<span class="dt">Tree'</span> (a,a))</code></pre></div>
<p>The word nested<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> refers to the fact that the type parameter changes during the recursion. Functions operating on such types require polymorphic recursion, an interesting language feature. The nested binary tree has two advantages over the usual representation: First, the type system guarantees that the tree is full (that is, every leaf has the same depth); second, since it lacks the extra indirection at the leaves, it takes less memory (by two machine words per element, with GHC). While the extra indirection can be also eliminated by modifying the original tree definition, that would result in less elegant and more complicated code.</p>
<p>This idea can be applied to our list-like data structures, giving for example the following very simple representation of leaf binary random-access lists:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Seq</span> a
  <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Nil</span>                   <span class="co">-- the empty sequence</span>
  <span class="fu">|</span> <span class="dt">Zero</span>   (<span class="dt">Seq</span> (a,a))    <span class="co">-- a sequence of even length</span>
  <span class="fu">|</span> <span class="dt">One</span>  a (<span class="dt">Seq</span> (a,a))    <span class="co">-- a sequence of odd length</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The implementation of the usual list operations is also very straightforward and simple (a Haskell implementation can be found at<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>). The same idea can be also applied to the other variations. The resulting data structures are somewhat reminiscent of finger trees<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, which are also implemented using nested data types; however, these are much simpler (of course, finger trees support more types of efficient operations).</p>
<p>A variation of the above idea uses the so-called skew numeral systems; these allow (modulo implementation details) guaranteed O(1) cons, in exchange for a slightly more complicated implementation. The resulting data structures use trees with data on both the nodes and the leaves (which also results in more compact in-memory representation). Okasaki uses the skew binary number system.</p>

<h3 id="kholomiov-talk">Csound-expression Haskell framework for computer music</h3>
<p><em>by Anton Kholomiov</em> (also see the corresponding <a href="#kholomiov-tutorial">tutorial</a>.)</p>
<p>The paper presents modern Haskell framework for creation of computer music. It’s called <a href="http://github.com/spell-music/csound-expression/">csound-expression</a>. It’s EDSL for Csound audio programming language. The functional programming paradigm can greatly enhance the process of text-based music production. We are going to look at functional model for computer music. It combines many aspects of computer music. With the library we can create instruments from scratch apply instruments to scores, trigger them with streams of events. We can create UIs to control our music.</p>
<p>The key guiding principle of API design is modularity. Creation of self-contained musical objects that can provide building blocks for the tower of abstractions. The library is designed in such a way that every concept is self contained and the whole program can be built from expressions. This feature allows us to construct music in the interactive style. We can create music in the REPL.</p>

<h3 id="thielemann">Efficient signal processing using Haskell and LLVM</h3>
<p><em>by <a href="http://dr.henning-thielemann.de/">Henning Thielemann</a></em></p>
<p>Haskell has so many features that are useful for signal processing: Lazy evaluation allows for infinite lists, simultaneous processing of a sequence of signal transformations and feedback, monads allow for proper handling of coherent and incoherent sources of noise, the type system allows for handling of sample rates via phantom types and for hiding internal filter parameters in opaque types. However, especially when relying on a lot of laziness your Haskell programs will be pretty slow in any Haskell implementation. In order to get reasonable processing speed you need to switch from lazy lists of sampled displacements to lazy lists of chunks of unboxed arrays. This compromise is pretty close to how signals are usually stored in signal processing packages written in machine oriented languages. However, GHC still fails to generate efficient code in cases that are hard to predict. It may be due to missing inlining, too much sharing of functions or too much laziness.</p>
<p>With the package <code>synthesizer-llvm</code> we address the issue of efficient signal processing. We use the LLVM Just-In-Time compiler in order to perform signal processing with maximum speed. LLVM provides optimization passes and vector instructions that enable us to achieve this goal. Our package also provides the programmer precise control over strict evaluation, code and data duplication or sharing.</p>
<p>In the tutorial we examine the examples included in the package, experiment with them and learn about the basic concepts of the package this way. The examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal producers like oscillators and noise generator,</li>
<li>Frequency filters and how to work with internal filter parameters beyond the restricting scheme of audio and control rates found in other digital signal processing frameworks,</li>
<li>Sample value types: Stereo sounds, binary logic signals, fixed-size arrays</li>
<li>Causal signal processes with arrows, sharing and feedback with proven absence of deadlocks,</li>
<li>Express arrows by plain functions,</li>
<li>Composing sequences of sounds, composing music from tones,</li>
<li>MIDI control of sounds,</li>
<li>Integration with ALSA and JACK,</li>
<li>Vectorisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I already gave a tutorial on LLVM at <a href="https://iba-cg.de/hal9.html">HaL-9</a> and chose simple signal processing as application. In this tutorial I will ignore the details of LLVM and just concentrate on the signal processing part. I do not plan to give an extensive introduction to signal processing, the focus is on how to get things done with <code>synthesizer-llvm</code>.</p>
<p>Since LLVM changes slightly with every release my LLVM bindings got a bit out of date. I am currently updating them. The tricky part to install is the package <code>llvm-ffi</code>. If you want to attend the tutorial and want to code with us, please send me your e-mail. I will then notify you when my packages are ready for installation and I will give you hints on the installation.</p>

<h3 id="kholomiov-tutorial">Workshop: creating computer music with Haskell</h3>
<p><em>by <a href="https://github.com/anton-k">Anton Kholomiov</a></em> (also see the corresponding <a href="#kholomiov-talk">talk</a>.)</p>
<p>At the Workshop we are going to learn to create computer music with Haskell. We are going to produce buzzes and blips right in the REPL. Right in the ghci you can create a midi-based instrument and complement it with drums and harmony from your favorite library of samples or create the melody from scratch with scores or event streams. Also we are going to learn how to create the UI-controllers on the fly with applicative style programming.</p>
<p>At the end of the workshop you should become en-armed with set of pro-quality synthesizers, tools to create sample based music, trigger them the music in real time. We should discuss some features unique to text-based programming. Have a glimpse at techniques used in musical generative art.</p>
<p>We are going to use the library <a href="http://github.com/spell-music/csound-expression/">csound-expression</a>. It’s a Haskell framework for sound design and music composition. It embeds very powerful audio programming language Csound into Haskell. It’s a Csound code generator. The <a href="http://csound.github.io/">Csound</a> is 30 years old audio programming language that embodies the wisdom of many researchers. It has active community and it continues to evolve. It has the wide set of features (subtractive, granular, waveguide, sample-based synthesis, physical modeling, spectral processing, emulators for many analog synthesizer components)</p>
<p>The Haskell library complements the Csound with expressive language. We can use the great low-level audio units of Csound and scheduler with higher level features of Haskell like higher order functions, rich data type system, body of libraries for advanced data types.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<p>To follow along you need to install several things:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/csound-expression">csound-expression</a>. It’s a main library (available on hackage).</li>
<li><a href="http://csound.github.io/">Csound compiler</a>. The thing that converts code to audio (available on official site works on all platforms).</li>
<li>other goodies based on core library: <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/csound-catalog">csound-catalog</a> and <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/csound-sampler">csound-sampler</a>. They contain ready to use high quality patches (available on Hackage) and tiny DSL to compose music with audio-clips.</li>
<li>the archive with audio files (drum loops and pads) that we are going to use. I’ll publish it when closer to the date.</li>
</ul>
<p>When everything installed check that it works. Open ghci import the module <code>Csound.Base</code> and type:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; dac (testDrone3 220)</code></pre>
<p>Hit Ctrl+C to stop the playback. The library has minimal Haskell dependencies and should be easy to install. If something will go wrong with installation drop me a line on github or on the email that you can find on Hackage page of the project.</p>
<p>The library is really huge though the core is very simple and minimal. So I recommend to read/skim through the <a href="https://github.com/spell-music/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/Index.md">user guide of the library</a>. That way you can get more out of the workshop.</p>
